**Author**: Joanna Coll
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

The application that I have build creates linked list and modifies it using find, remove and reduce function followed by thorough testing in case of linked list being empty.


## Getting Started

To start you need to create (add values to) linked list to be able to test it later.
Next we use find function to find the value we want to remove out of the list. We have to test the situation when value equals the head of the list or if the value is the last on the list.
Later we create reduce function. For the purpose of testing the reduce function will be adding all the values together untill it gets a single value.


## Architecture
JavaScript, Node.js, Airbnb package, babelrc, other dependencies
